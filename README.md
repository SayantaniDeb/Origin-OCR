# Origin-OCR
This is a program for Optical Character Recognition(OCR), made using pytesseract (https://pypi.org/project/pytesseract/)
I expect this to be cross platfrom though I didn't test this on linux, But should work IDK.
I made a shitty GUI with Tkinter which can process single files or multiple files in a folder.
**Though The GUI has the "ben" option for Bengali character recognition you'll need to download Bengali traineddata from [here](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tessdata) as ben.traineddata and copy it into the tessdata folder of your tesseract installation folder.**

## Requirements:
i)  Install the packages in the setup/requirements.txt file
ii) Install [Tesseract](Link : https://tesseract-ocr.github.io/tessdoc/Home.html)
  Direct Links for Noobs like me :
  [Winddows](https://github.com/UB-Mannheim/tesseract/wiki)
  Linux : 
  >sudo apt-get install tesseract-ocr
  >sudo apt-get install tesseract-dev

I'll Be Very Happy If this is of Any use to you. Peace
