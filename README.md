# Origin-OCR
This is a program for Optical Character Recognition(OCR), made using pytesseract (https://pypi.org/project/pytesseract/)<br />
I expect this to be cross platfrom though I didn't test this on linux, But should work IDK.<br />
I made a shitty GUI with Tkinter which can process single files or multiple files in a folder.<br />
**Though The GUI has the "ben" option for Bengali character recognition you'll need to download Bengali traineddata from [here](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tessdata) as ben.traineddata and copy it into the tessdata folder of your tesseract installation folder.**<br />

## Requirements:
i)  Install the packages in the setup/requirements.txt file<br />
ii) Install [Tesseract](https://tesseract-ocr.github.io/tessdoc/Home.html)<br />
  Direct Links for Noobs like me :<br />
  [Windows](https://github.com/UB-Mannheim/tesseract/wiki)<br />
  Linux : <br />
  >sudo apt-get install tesseract-ocr && sudo apt-get install tesseract-dev
  
I'll Be Very Happy If this is of Any use to you. Peace
